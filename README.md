# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning (Self-Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a self-learning machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn using supervised learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service based on historical customer data and behavior patterns.

Customer churn prediction is widely used in industries like telecom, banking, SaaS, and e-commerce to improve customer retention and business performance.
